# Blood-Bank-Management-System-
3.2 ISD lab project 
As we all know about the need of blood hence it became very important to fulfill its need
when itâ€™s required in the minimum possible time. So now with the help of these blood bank
systems it will be easy to find blood in nearby areas. With this system, the user of this
system can search for desired blood group and can easily manage the donor. The result
of test of the donor will indicate whether the donor can donate blood to patient or not. In
our project, the user will have to log in and then they will have to register. There is also a
dashboard, which will be controlled by the admin panel. From here, the users will be able
to get the update of available blood group, patient detail etc. This blood bank management
system project is going to be a successful innovation in our country because we will be
able to save the life of people.
